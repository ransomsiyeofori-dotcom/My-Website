 <p class="tit">Breadth and balance are just two features of a Sunrise's education </p>
 <p class="ty">At Sunrise School, we offer a broad and balanced curriculum that creates a strong blend of academic, artistic, dramatic, musical, and sporting experiences for every child. Our aim is to nurture confident, well-rounded learners who are prepared for the future.</p>
<p class="ty">In Years 3 and 4, children are taught in their class groups for core subjects such as English, Science, History, Geography, PSHE, and Religious Studies. Specialist teachers guide them in Art, Computing, Design Technology, French, Music, Physical Education, Swimming, and Games. From Year 3 upwards, pupils are grouped for Mathematics according to ability to ensure the right level of challenge and support. Homework in Maths and English is set in manageable amounts to reinforce learning.</p>
<p class="ty">From Years 5 to 8, each child is assigned a Tutor who meets them daily and remains their first point of contact for guidance and support.</p> <p class="ty">In Year 5, pupils develop greater independence as they move between classrooms and are taught primarily by subject specialist teachers. They are also introduced to additional subjects such as Latin and Drama. Where English is not a child’s first language, specialist EAL support may be provided to ensure full access to the curriculum. Homework expectations gradually increase, helping pupils develop responsibility and strong study habits.</p>
<p class="ty">From Year 7 onwards, pupils are grouped by ability in examined subjects to maximize progress. Some subjects may be taught in these ability groups, while others remain in mixed-ability tutor groups. Non-examined subjects are generally delivered in mixed-ability settings to encourage collaboration and inclusive learning.</p>
<p class="ty">At Sunrise School, our senior curriculum is carefully structured to prepare pupils for secondary education and beyond. We have adopted a dynamic and forward-thinking curriculum pathway that blends the strengths of traditional academic programmes with elements of the National Curriculum and modern learning approaches. This ensures our pupils are fully equipped with the knowledge, skills, and confidence needed for future success.For more information about our curriculum structure, please contact the school office. </p>

<blockquote class="block">“Since our daughter joined Sunrise School, I have witnessed remarkable progress in her. Her academic performance has improved significantly, and she has become more confident and independent. I firmly believe that this is a direct result of the excellent teaching staff and the comprehensive educational programmes at your school. The teachers’ dedication and passion for education have inspired her to strive for excellence and I am deeply grateful for their guidance and support.”​ <span class="sa"> <b>Year 7 boarding parent, May 2025</b></span></blockquote>

   <p class="it">"There's a real depth of learning in these upper prep years - in a science lesson, pupils eloquently explained topics they'd chosen to research, including use of VR in the Royal Navy, pig heart transplants and quantum mechanics."</p>
